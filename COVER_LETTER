# Cover Letter — SIG742 Capstone (Modern Data Science)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I recently completed a Master’s in Data Science at Deakin University and co-led a capstone project analysing 552k+ business reviews with PySpark, NLP, ARIMA vs LSTM forecasting, and a hybrid recommender. I owned Part 1 (data acquisition/EDA), while B. K. Chaitanya and Faris Dawod owned Parts 2 and 3 respectively. Key outcomes included uncovering timestamp anomalies, building a walk-forward ARIMA baseline, and an LSTM that matched performance, plus a memory-efficient hybrid KNN recommender.

I’m excited to bring the same rigour to your team.

Best regards,  
Victor Prefa
